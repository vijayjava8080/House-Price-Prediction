# House Price Prediction
## Overview
This project predicts residential property sale prices using Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net linear regression methods. The "house_price_dataset" is utilized, focusing on key features. Models are implemented with gradient descent optimization from scratch, and performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE, RMSE, R2, and Adjusted R2.

## Abstract
Accurate house price predictions are crucial for real estate decisions. This study explores Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models, emphasizing data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation for optimal prediction.

## Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform data.
- Model Training: Implement Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net models from scratch.
- Model Evaluation: Assess performance using key metrics.

## Methodology
- Data Processing: Encode variables, normalize data.
- Model Creation: Develop Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net models.
- Training and Evaluation: Split data, train models, and evaluate performance.
  
## Results
Lasso regression, implemented from scratch, outperformed other models based on R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into effective regression methods for accurate house price predictions, benefiting real estate decisions.
